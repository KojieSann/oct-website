            The Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) is a four-year program
            consisting of general education and professional courses.
            Professional courses begin in the first year and thread through the
            development of competencies up to the fourth year level. The BSN
            program provides an intensive nursing practicum that will refine
            clinical skills from the first year level to ensure basic clinical
            competencies required of a beginning nurse practitioner.
