            <p>
              Dr. Jean Rizza Dela Cruz, College Dean, opened the day by assuring
              the students of a quality education and improvements for the
              Olivarians. “What we can assure you is that this is a new
              opportunity for learning and growth," said Dr. Dela Cruz in her
              opening remarks.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Rest assured that our faculty members and our members of the
              administration will be supporting you all the way, so we will be
              able to achieve your dreams and your goals in life," she added as
              she talked about the challenges that will be encountered along the
              student’s academic journey.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, a surprise was revealed in the orientation, as OCT’s
              classroom, laboratories, and other facilities are now fully
              equipped with air conditioning units.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition to welcoming the students, OCT held a raffle during
              the program to distribute merchandise such as tote bags and mugs,
              as well as cash prizes and a brand new laptop.
            </p>
            <p>
              Discussion of policies, reminders, and guidance was also done by
              the respective heads of each department.
            </p>
            <p>
              The said orientation was conducted in two batches: students from
              the Bachelor of Science in Criminology, Bachelor of Science in
              Accountancy and Accounting Information System, Bachelor of Science
              in Business Administration, and Bachelor of Science in Information
              Technology held their orientation in the morning.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, the second batch held theirs in the afternoon
              and consisted of students from the Bachelor of Science in Nursing,
              Bachelor of Science in Tourism Management, Bachelor of Science in
              Hospitality Management, Bachelor of Elementary Education, as well
              as the students of Caregiving and Bread and Pastry Production
              (TESDA short courses).
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, BS Information Technology was recognized and topped as the
              outstanding enrollment growth rate for the academic year, while BS
              Criminology remains the most populated program in OCT.
